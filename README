# jype

jype provides a formal approach to precisely defined the schema of a
JSON data structure.

  * JSON values can be validate against the schema.
  
  * Static checking is provided to validate whether the schema is well
    formed.
    
  * A package system is built in to facilitate modular design.  A
    "depackaging" compilation is provided to transform a schema with
    packages to one without packages, while preserving the semantics.
